# Pradeep Kumar | Embedded Systems Portfolio

A high-fidelity, interactive portfolio built for an **Embedded Software Engineer**. This project showcases expertise in firmware architecture, drone avionics, and real-time systems through a "System HUD" inspired interface.

## 🚀 Overview
This portfolio is designed to mimic the aesthetic of a high-tech diagnostic terminal. It features:
- **Interactive Circuit Visualizations**: SVG-based animated logic gates and microcontroller bus flows (STM32/ESP32).
- **Holographic Navigation**: A minimalist "System HUD" navigation bar with dynamic hover-reveal labels.
- **Responsive "Embedded" UI**: Tailored for both desktop and mobile, ensuring high-integrity presentation across all devices.
- **Particle Background**: A custom-coded "Neural Network" background that reacts to user interaction.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Graphics**: Custom SVG Animations & Canvas API
- **Deployment**: ES Modules via `importmap` (Buildless-ready)

## 📁 Project Structure
- `App.tsx`: The main system orchestrator.
- `components/`: Modular UI components (Navbar, Logic Circuits, Background).
- `types.ts`: Strictly typed data structures for experience and skills.
- `index.html`: Optimized entry point with system-wide styling.

## ⚙️ Local Setup
To view this project locally:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
3. (Optional) For a full development environment, use a local server like `npx serve .` to ensure all ES modules load correctly.
